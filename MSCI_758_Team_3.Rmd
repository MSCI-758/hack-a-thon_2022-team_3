```

The figure (above) shows that the number of waterbody impairments in the state of South Carolina has largely increased for 7 of the 8 major river basins within the state. The Broad River basin is the only exception.  This is likely attributed to more strict water quality standards at present compared to 1998 water quality standards, however increased rates of urbanization and agricultural intensity may have caused negative water quality effects within SC waterbodies.

imp_sc_join_2008=sc%>%

glimpse(imp_sc_join_2008)
```

Now that the data is ready to plot, I initially created a map of the ratio of area of water/total area of county. This can help explain the distribution of priority ranks and why some counties possess far greater impairments than others.

```{r}
# create a map with ratio of water to land per county
  ### ONLY USED ONCE FOR ALL 3 YEAR COMPARISONS
area_ratio=imp_sc_join_2018%>%
  select(NAME,
         count_ranks,
         ALAND,
         AWATER)%>%
  mutate(ratio=AWATER/(ALAND+AWATER))   # ratio of water to land
glimpse(area_ratio)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=area_ratio, aes(fill=ratio))+ # color counties by water area
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("green", "orange", "red"))+
  ggtitle("Ratio of Water to Land (m^2)")
```

The following figures are the number of impairments by county for the years 2008 and 2018. We can see an increase in ranks along the coast, but there are no dramatic changes in ranks over the 10 years. The coastal counties, as illustrated by the water ratio map, possess the highest number of impairments which is what we would expect. Interestingly, Greenville county has a high number of impaired waterbodies but a low ratio of water to land.

```{r}
# plot 2008
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=imp_sc_join_2008, aes(fill=count_ranks))+ # color counties by no. ranks
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("green", "orange", "red"))+
  ggtitle("2008 Impairments by County")

# plot 2018
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=imp_sc_join_2018, aes(fill=count_ranks))+ # color counties by no. ranks
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("green", "orange", "red"))+
  ggtitle("2018 Impairments by County")
```

Finally, I plotted the same maps, but by basin rather than county. Several basins show small increases in impairment numbers, while there is no evident decrease in the others.

#### South Carolina Case Study of Waterbody Improvement

Coneross Creek and Beaverdam Creek

Fecal coliforms (FCs) are the number one cause of waterbody impairments in the state of South Carolina (349 impairments in 2018).  These bacterium emerge in human, livestock, or wildlife feces, and can be transported as nonpoint source pollution following large rainfall events.  Major sources of FCs include livestock operations and failing septic systems in rural areas.  A combination of these two sources resulted in the impairment of the Coneross Creek and Beaverdam Creek (below) in Northwest South Carolina in 1998.  Consequently, both creeks were placed on the South Carolina Dept. of Environmental Health Control (SC DHEC) 303d list of impaired waters in 1998 and deemed high priority waterbodies.  

![Beaverdam Creek; Source: Michael Miller, August 2013](images/Beaver_Dam_Creek.jpg)

Total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for FCs were established for Beaverdam Creek in 2000 and Coneross Creek in 2002.  The TMDLs determine a set amount of FCs that can enter the creeks while still allowing them to meet their intended uses, which in the case of Beaverdam and Coneross Creeks, are recreational uses.  TMDL establishment allowed for the creeks to be removed from the 303d list; however, a management plan was required to reduce the amount of FCs that were entering these creeks in the past.  A collaborative team comprised of the SC DHEC, Clemson University, United States Dept. of Agriculture-Natural Resource Conservation Service, Oconee County Soil and Water Conservation Service, and Oconee County Cattlemen's Association implemented and completed a $1.1 million dollar project to restore the water quality of Coneross and Beaverdam Creeks.  The project focused on community education, restoration of failed septic systems, and best management practice (BMP) installation within the 47,016 acre Coneross Creek watershed and the 9,099 acre Beaverdam Creek watershed.  In 2005, both creeks succesfully met their TMDLs and have been restored to meet their intended recreational use.  

This is just one of the many success stories of how water quality is being improved in South Carolina's waterbodies.  However, there were 1,238 waterbodies listed on the 2018 SC DHEC 303d list, a number which is likely to increase for the 2020 303d list.  Funds must be allocated equitably across the state and stakeholders must be willing to work together to solve the wicked problem that is nonpoint source pollution.  This is a mighty task, but one that can be achieved if we South Carolinians prioritize the health of our waterbodies and hold each other accountable!
